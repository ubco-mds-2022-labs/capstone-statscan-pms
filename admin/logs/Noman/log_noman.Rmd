The following is a recommended way of keeping track of your weekly hours using this RMarkdown file.
Note that it will do all the calculations for you, you just need to enter in hours worked and a description of the task in the correct spot.

```{r}
mylog <- data.frame(week = 1, 
                    day = as.Date("2023-05-02"),
                    hours = 2.5,
                    description = "capstone kickoff lecture",
                    comments = NA
                    )

```

## Instructions

1. For each week, first set the `current.week` to the week number (in most cases, you can increment the `current.week` by 1).\

2. Add row entries to your table indicating the date of the task, the number of hours spent on the task, a description of the task, as well any comments (or reminders to yourself) or requests for follow-up.

3. Knit the file to a markdown file.

4. Before Friday at 5 PM, please submit a Pull Request to merge in your weekly log. All your team mates will review your log, provide comments and suggestions, and then approve (or request changes). Once all the changes have been resolved, you can merge in your pull request (by Monday at 10 AM).

5. Don't forget to review the Pull Requests by your team mates!

6. Discuss any discrepancies or team dynamics issues with your assigned TA during the weekly meetings.

**Remember that your `markdown` file is what will be reviewed by your teammates, the TAs, and the instructors, so just make sure it renders correctly!**

### Weekly Reflection

In this section, please write 5-7 sentences (in total) answering the following questions:

1. What was your most significant **individual contribution** to the project this week?
Fitting Mclust model and also a k-means model called k-mediod, which is an algorithm that is robust to outliers. The reason being was to see whether we get better metrics scores if we directly handle these outliers. Surprisingly, the cutoff values were very similiar to MixAll for some ammenities.

2. What was your most significant **team contribution** to the project this week?
Participating in our team dynamics meeting. I felt it was super valuable to gauge how everyone in our group was feeling mentally. We had a great group discussion and ironed out any concerns thus far. 

3. Are there any major blockers or roadblocks preventing you from proceeding on your project?
I think its important that we can find an agreed upon way to find a best clustering algorithm with the results we have thus far so we can highlight the group profiles.

## Summary Table

To get the total for all the weekly hourly summary over each week use the following (requires the **dplyr** package)
```{r}
mylog %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(total_weekly_hours = sum(hours)) %>%
  kable()
```
