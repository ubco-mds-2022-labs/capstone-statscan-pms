The following is a recommended way of keeping track of your weekly hours
using this RMarkdown file. Note that it will do all the calculations for
you, you just need to enter in hours worked and a description of the
task in the correct spot.

## Instructions

1.  For each week, first set the `current.week` to the week number (in
    most cases, you can increment the `current.week` by 1).  

2.  Add row entries to your table indicating the date of the task, the
    number of hours spent on the task, a description of the task, as
    well any comments (or reminders to yourself) or requests for
    follow-up.

3.  Knit the file to a markdown file.

4.  Before Friday at 5 PM, please submit a Pull Request to merge in your
    weekly log. All your team mates will review your log, provide
    comments and suggestions, and then approve (or request changes).
    Once all the changes have been resolved, you can merge in your pull
    request (by Monday at 10 AM).

5.  Don’t forget to review the Pull Requests by your team mates!

6.  Discuss any discrepancies or team dynamics issues with your assigned
    TA during the weekly meetings.

**Remember that your `markdown` file is what will be reviewed by your
teammates, the TAs, and the instructors, so just make sure it renders
correctly!**

## Week 1

Add individual contributions here (be sure to call the **tidyverse** and
**knitr** package first)

### Weekly Reflection

In this section, please write 5-7 sentences (in total) answering the
following questions:

1.  What was your most significant **individual contribution** to the
    project this week? Fitting Mclust model and also a k-means model
    called k-mediod, which is an algorithm that is robust to outliers.
    The reason being was to see whether we get better metrics scores if
    we directly handle these outliers. Surprisingly, the cutoff values
    were very similiar to MixAll for some ammenities.

2.  What was your most significant **team contribution** to the project
    this week? Participating in our team dynamics meeting. I felt it was
    super valuable to gauge how everyone in our group was feeling
    mentally. We had a great group discussion and ironed out any
    concerns thus far.

3.  Are there any major blockers or roadblocks preventing you from
    proceeding on your project? I think its important that we can find
    an agreed upon way to find a best clustering algorithm with the
    results we have thus far so we can highlight the group profiles.
