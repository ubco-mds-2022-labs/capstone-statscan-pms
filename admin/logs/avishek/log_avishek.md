<!-- 
The following is a recommended way of keeping track of your weekly hours using this RMarkdown file.
Note that it will do all the calculations for you, you just need to enter in hours worked and a description of the task in the correct spot.
-->
<!--

## Instructions

1. For each week, first set the `current.week` to the week number (in most cases, you can increment the `current.week` by 1).\

2. Add row entries to your table indicating the date of the task, the number of hours spent on the task, a description of the task, as well any comments (or reminders to yourself) or requests for follow-up.

3. Knit the file to a markdown file.

4. Before Friday at 5 PM, please submit a Pull Request to merge in your weekly log. All your team mates will review your log, provide comments and suggestions, and then approve (or request changes). Once all the changes have been resolved, you can merge in your pull request (by Monday at 10 AM).

5. Don't forget to review the Pull Requests by your team mates!

6. Discuss any discrepancies or team dynamics issues with your assigned TA during the weekly meetings.

**Remember that your `markdown` file is what will be reviewed by your teammates, the TAs, and the instructors, so just make sure it renders correctly!**

### Weekly Reflection

<!-- In this section, please write 5-7 sentences (in total) answering the following questions: -->
<!-- 1. What was your most significant **individual contribution** to the project this week? -->

-   My most significant individual contribution to the project this week
    was in exploratory data analysis and visualization. I found out that
    even though the proximity measures are normalized there are huge
    amount of outliers across all proximity measures indices and had
    done different tests such as Rosners Outlier Test to validate those.
    Also, got some useful insights from the map visualizations.

<!-- 2. What was your most significant **team contribution** to the project this week? -->

-   My most significant team contribution was discovering outliers and
    telling the team that we need to be careful when choosing models for
    clustering as our model has to be robust against outliers which I
    also confirmed with Jesse (TA).

<!-- 3. Are there any major blockers or roadblocks preventing you from proceeding on your project? -->

-   This week, I encountered some significant challenges, including
    running out of memory when allocating vectors and dealing with
    excessively long running times. As a result, I had to search for
    alternative approaches to address running out of memory issue.
    However, as the dataset is large it took long time to run models on
    the entire dataset.

    suggesting different number of clusters but we need to pick one for
    profiling.
