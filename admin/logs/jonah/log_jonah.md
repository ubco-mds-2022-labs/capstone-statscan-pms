The following is a recommended way of keeping track of your weekly hours
using this RMarkdown file. Note that it will do all the calculations for
you, you just need to enter in hours worked and a description of the
task in the correct spot.

## Instructions

1.  For each week, first set the `current.week` to the week number (in
    most cases, you can increment the `current.week` by 1).

2.  Add row entries to your table indicating the date of the task, the
    number of hours spent on the task, a description of the task, as
    well any comments (or reminders to yourself) or requests for
    follow-up.

3.  Knit the file to a markdown file.

4.  Before Friday at 5 PM, please submit a Pull Request to merge in your
    weekly log. All your team mates will review your log, provide
    comments and suggestions, and then approve (or request changes).
    Once all the changes have been resolved, you can merge in your pull
    request (by Monday at 10 AM).

5.  Don’t forget to review the Pull Requests by your team mates!

6.  Discuss any discrepancies or team dynamics issues with your assigned
    TA during the weekly meetings.

**Remember that your `markdown` file is what will be reviewed by your
teammates, the TAs, and the instructors, so just make sure it renders
correctly!**

### Weekly Reflection

In this section, please write 5-7 sentences (in total) answering the
following questions:

1.  What was your most significant **individual contribution** to the
    project this week?

The most significant individual contribution was the ClustImpute
document, which is an application and analysis of the PMD using the
ClustImpute package. Part of this was creating reproducible code that we
will be able to use again in applying other algorithms.

1.  What was your most significant **team contribution** to the project
    this week?

The most significant team contribution was definitely fixing the
proposal. We met for almost 5 hours straight and ironed out all the
errors.

1.  Are there any major blockers or roadblocks preventing you from
    proceeding on your project?

There are two roadblocks:

-   git - we are having issues with large file storage
-   memory - due to the size of the dataset and the algorithmic
    approaches being used, many of the group members’ computers run out
    of memory and crash, mine included. There are some workarounds, but
    it is wasting time and preventing us from doing some things, such as
    certain algorithms and making plots with shapefiles.

### Weekly Reflection

In this section, please write 5-7 sentences (in total) answering the
following questions:

1.  What was your most significant **individual contribution** to the
    project this week?

The most significant individual contribution was coding the new
clustering template with new information from the DEIL meeting, as well
as using this template to attempt the HDBSCAN approach.

1.  What was your most significant **team contribution** to the project
    this week?

The most significant team contribution was meeting with the DEIL team to
discuss some very important project-guiding questions that changed the
trajectory of where we are headed with the project. This meeting was
very important.

1.  Are there any major blockers or roadblocks preventing you from
    proceeding on your project?

At this point, I do not think there are any large roadblocks, aside from
the stuff mentioned last week. However, I am noticing that 2 months is a
very short timeframe for a project like this, and that our project could
easily be extended to be a year long.

took me all day Tuesday to figure out.

    this week?

My most significant team contribution this week was working on the
presentation. We spent a lot of time perfecting and practicing it, and I

### Weekly Reflection

In this section, please write 5-7 sentences (in total) answering the
following questions:

1.  What was your most significant **individual contribution** to the
    project this week?

My most significant individual contribution this week was getting the
first draft of the final report off the ground. I spent a fair amount of
time doing this, and have the majority of the methods and results done,
along with their accompanying plots and tables.

1.  What was your most significant **team contribution** to the project
    this week?

My most significant team contribution this week was participating in the
team dynamics discussion. Everyone was able to say their bit, and from
my perspective, things are resolved now.

1.  Are there any major blockers or roadblocks preventing you from
    proceeding on your project?

We need to decide on a criterion/metric for comparing our modeling
approaches. This should ideally be done before cluster profiling and
report writing. However, we are having difficulty deciding this, and
have booked a meeting with Jeff so that he can help us. Issue is, it’s
scheduled for the 8th, a few days later than we would like. We may end
up just choosing something, and then going back and fixing it once we
get some ideas from Jeff.
