There are 489,676 rows in this data and 41 columns, where each row represents a unique DB'. The 41 columns include information about the dissemination blocks themselves such as ID, population, and coordinates, as well as information about other census boundaries like dissemination areas, census areas, and provinces. Each of the 10 amenities have two columns associated with it: one a binary indicator to track whether the amenity is present in the DB itself, and the other the calculated proximity measure. Finally there are three indicators: transit_na, amenity_dense, and suppressed.

# Missing Values

## Missing values percentage

Statistics Canada use some specific notation for missing values. The following standard symbols are used in Statistics Canada publications:  

| Symbol | Meaning                                       |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ..     | not available for a specific reference period |
| F      | too unreliable to be published                |

When there are NA values in the dataset for proximity indices, it suggests that the corresponding amenity is situated beyond the defined proximity threshold. These thresholds differ depending on the type of amenity. For instance, for public transit stops, the proximity threshold is set at a 1 km walking distance, while for libraries, it is set at a 1.5 km walking distance.

By changing these symbols to NA missing percentages are (not included the columns with 0 percent)

```{r}
pmd[pmd == ".." | pmd == "F"] <- NA
```

```{r}
# getting proportions of nas
na_prop <- function(x) {sum(is.na(x))/length(x)*100}
na_props <- sort(apply(pmd, 2, na_prop), decreasing = TRUE)
na_props <- na_props[na_props > 0]

# Print the table
kable(na_props) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

From the above table, we can see that the library proximity indicator contains the most missing values, almost 77%, followed by the proximity measures for grocery and secondary education. Only two out of the ten amenities have proximity measures missing proportion under 50%: health and employment. 

## All proximity measures are NA

```{r}
# Check if there are any dbs where all proximity measures are missing
all_prox_na <- pmd[rowSums(is.na(pmd[,prox_cols])) == length(prox_cols), ]
cat("No. of rows: All proximity measures are NA", nrow(all_prox_na))
```

There are 64764 dissemination blocks where none of the proximity measures are available. Let's check the population of those dissemination blocks.

```{r echo=TRUE}
cat("Some DB Population where all pms are NA ", unique(all_prox_na$DBPOP)[1:5], "\n")
cat("Largest DB population where all pms are NA ",sort(unique(all_prox_na$DBPOP), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5])
```

```{r}
# Calculate the mode of the population values
pop_freq <- table(na.omit(pmd$DBPOP))
mode <- as.numeric(names(pop_freq)[pop_freq == max(pop_freq)])

# Print the mode
cat("Mode of DB population:", mode)
```
In summary table we also saw the mean is 71.83. Compare to that there are DB's with larger population that has no proximity measures. These amenities might not have met the proposed criterion and so are considered NA. To gain insights into the population distribution within these DBs, we visualize it in the Distributions section.

# Distributions

## Dissemination Block per Province

```{r}
# Count the number dbs' that fall under each province
db_counts <- pmd %>% count(prov = pmd$PRNAME)

# Order the levels of prov based on count values
db_counts$prov <- factor(db_counts$prov, levels = db_counts$prov[order(db_counts$n, decreasing = TRUE)])

# Create bar chart
ggplot(db_counts, aes(x = prov, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, color = "black", size = 3.5) +
  labs(title = "Number of DBs' per Province",
       x = "",
       y = "No. of DBs'") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Population per Province  

```{r}
unique_population <- unique(pmd[, c("PRNAME", "PRPOP")])

# Order the dataframe in decreasing order of PRPOP
unique_population <- unique_population[order(unique_population$PRPOP, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Set PRNAME as a factor with levels in the desired order
unique_population$PRNAME <- factor(unique_population$PRNAME, levels = unique_population$PRNAME)

# Create the bar plot
ggplot(unique_population, aes(x = PRNAME, y = PRPOP)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = PRPOP), vjust = -0.5, color = "black", size = 3.5) +
  labs(title = "Population by Province",
       x = "",
       y = "Population") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

There is a significant population disparity between British Columbia (BC) and Saskatchewan, despite both provinces having a similar number of DBs. This difference may be attributed to various factors such as the delineation of DBs and the geographical characteristics of the provinces. Saskatchewan, with its flat terrain and extensive farmlands, is characterized by a grid-like road system, resulting in numerous DBs. In contrast, British Columbia's mountainous landscape has fewer roads, leading to a lower number of DBs.

It is important to note that the number of DBs does not necessarily correspond directly to population size. Provinces can have fewer DBs with a larger population or vice versa, depending on factors such as geographical features, transportation infrastructure, and the criteria used for defining DBs.


## Proportion of missing values for each amenity by province  

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
# Getting infos from data 
num_prox_cols <- grep("prox", colnames(pmd)) # column numbers of proximity measures
prov_code <- unique(pmd$PRUID) # province codes
prov_name <- unique(pmd$PRNAME) # province abbreviations


#initialize a matrix and empty list
mat_missing = matrix(data=NA, ncol=length(num_prox_cols), nrow=length(prov_code))
amt_rows <- c()

# Making a matrix of amenities x provinces, percentage missing values
for (i in 1:length(prov_code)){
  # get the number of rows for each province
  amt_rows[i] <- nrow(filter(pmd, pmd$PRUID == prov_code[i]))
  for (j in 1:length(num_prox_cols)){
    # for every province, iterate through every amenity and get percentage missing
    amt_miss <- nrow(filter(pmd, is.na(pmd[,num_prox_cols[j]]) & pmd$PRUID == prov_code[i]))
    mat_missing[i,j] <- amt_miss/amt_rows[i]
  }
}

# build dataframe, rename columns and rows
df_perc_missing <- mat_missing %>% data.frame() %>% setNames(prox_cols)
rownames(df_perc_missing) <- prov_name

df_perc_missing <- cbind(prov_name, df_perc_missing)

#df_perc_missing

# flattening so can facet
df_perc_missing %>% pivot_longer(all_of(prox_cols)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = value, x = prov_name, fill = prov_name)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Missing values for each province by amenity") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

We see in the above figure that overall, employment has the lowest rates of missing values, but has also more range depending on the province. Ontario and Quebec seems to have the least missing values for most amenities relative to the other regions, whereas Nunavut usually has the most. It seems like the amount of proximity measure missing for libraries are the most consistent across regions.

## Logistic Curve

For each amenity, we can plot the occurrence of missing values in a DB vs its population, and plot a basic logistics curve.

```{r}
# convert data so NA = 1, other = 0
df_na <- pmd

# converting all values to 0 and all na to 1 for amenities cols
df_na[prox_cols][!is.na(df_na[prox_cols])] <- 0
df_na[prox_cols][is.na(df_na[prox_cols])] <- 1
```

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
# plot logistics curve for amenity and population
# couldn't figure out easy way to get it; for loops weren't working, and facet involves flattening but I wanted to keep most of the info incase I needed it
#par(mfrow = c(2,5))
ggplot(df_na, aes(x=DBPOP, y=prox_idx_emp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  stat_smooth(method="glm", se=FALSE, method.args = list(family=binomial)) + labs(title = "Logistic regression curve (1-NA) vs population")

```

The employment curve is included above, and the remainder are found in the appendix. We see that for some amenities, like employment and health, the missing values are concentrated among DBs with small populations. These are the same amenities with less than 50% of values missing. Overall it seems like the population of the DB is not the only factor, if at all, affecting whether a proximity measure is missing for that DB.

We can also plot the histograms of missing values vs populations for each amenity below, where '1' (blue) is a missing value and '0' (pink) is a value not missing. Again, the remainder are found in the appendix.

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# I should really just facet it
par(mfrow = c(5,2))
ggplot(df_na) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=DBPOP, fill=factor(prox_idx_emp)), bins = 40,
                 colour="grey50", alpha=0.5, position="identity") + labs(title = "Histogram NA values vs rest by population for employment")
```

Overall, there are more DBs with lower populations than larger populations. We see that for some amenities, at smaller populations, there are a lot more missing values. Again, employment and health are the only two where there are always more actual values than missing values at every population bin. 

```{r eval = F}
# ### Model with other variables to see relationship: need add 'master' df
# basic model with only population
log_mod <- glm(prox_idx_emp~DBPOP, data = df_na)
summary(log_mod)
# diagnostics
plot(log_mod)
```

## Violin plots of Proximity Measures  

We can take a preliminary look at the distribution of proximity measures for each amenity, to see if there are 'obvious' clusters.

```{r}
# manipulate dataframe to only keep amenities cols
df_violin <- subset(pmd, select = prox_cols)
# rename cols for easier plot reading
names(df_violin) <- sub('prox_idx_', '', names(df_violin))
prox_cols_short <- names(df_violin)
# pivot to long to make work with plots
df_violin_long <- pivot_longer(df_violin, all_of(prox_cols_short))
```

```{r fig.height= 4, fig.width=6}
ggplot(df_violin_long, aes(x = value, y = name)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(y = "Amenity", title = "Distribution of proximity measures by amenity") 
  
```

From the violin plot above, detecting any clear clustering patterns with naked eyes is challenging here. It is evident that the majority of proximity values for all amenities are concentrated below 0.12. Among the amenities, health exhibits the highest distribution density closest to zero, followed by employment and transit. On the other hand, library displays the lowest density near zero and starts at a slightly later point. It is noteworthy that health and employment have the fewest missing values, whereas library has the highest number of missing values. This observation suggests that there may be a significant number of DBs for libraries where the distances exceed the threshold proximity. 

## Kernel Density plots of Proximity Measures  

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=6}
# Create a melted data frame for the boxplot
df <- reshape2::melt(pmd[, prox_cols])
# kernel density plots
ggplot(df, aes(x = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Value") +
  ylab("Density") +
  ggtitle("Density plots of proximity indices") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = 'free_y', nrow = 5) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

We see that most curves appear smooth, but some like for primary education, secondary education, and library, have 'bumps', which could indicate clusters. Overall, the naked eye is not able to perceive obvious segmentation cutoffs.

## Distribution of CSD Population

```{r}
ggplot(pmd, aes(x = CSDPOP)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("CSD Population") +
  ylab("Density") +
  ggtitle("Kernel Density Plot of CSD Population")
```

The above plot reveals a heavily right-skewed distribution, indicating that the majority of CSDs (Census Subdivisions) have a relatively low population. The presence of small bumps on the right side suggests the existence of a few CSDs with higher population values, although they are less common compared to the majority of CSDs with lower populations. Overall, the plot highlights the concentration of CSDs with low population values and the scarcity of highly populated CSDs.

## Distribution of amenity_dense

```{r}
ggplot(pmd, aes(x=as.factor(amenity_dense) )) +
  geom_bar(width=0.7, fill="steelblue") +
  geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=-0.5) +
  labs(x = "Amenity Dense")
```

37303 DBs' are in an amenity dense neighbourhood, 
4827 DBs' are in a high amenity density neighbourhood, 
442179 DBs' are in a non-amenity dense neighbourhood.

An “amenity dense neighbourhood” is defined as a dissemination block that has access to at least a grocery store, pharmacy, and public transit stop within 1 km walking; a child care facility, primary school, and library within 1.5 km walking; a health facility within 3 km driving; and employment within 10 km driving. In this characterization, the indicator is inherently focused on predominantly urbanized areas, due to both the distance ranges as well as the presence of typical urban-based services, such as public transit.

## Population zero

```{r eval=FALSE}
# how many DB have population of 0
nrow(filter(pmd, pmd$DBPOP == 0))/nrow(pmd)
```

About 24% of the DBs in Canada (in 2016) have a population of 0. It could be reasonable to expect that if the population of a DB is 0, then the proximity measure are also near 0: it is intuitive that for the most part, amenities are further away from areas with no populations. It is thus reasonable to explore the cases where the population is zero, to see its prevalence, and deduce how it may affect the values of proximity measures. DBs with a population of zero may also occur in amenity dense areas: they may be industrial areas, or work areas where people do not live, or even areas with ‘nothing’ in them but are just separated by roads, like between highways. 

### DBs with a population of zero by Province

```{r}
PRNAME <- unique(pmd$PRNAME)

pmd %>% filter(DBPOP == 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(PRNAME)) + 
  geom_bar(fill="steelblue") + 
  labs(x = "",
    title = "How many DBs with population zero by province") +
  geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=-0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

#cowplot::plot_grid(p1,p2)
```

In the above plot, we can see that the province with the most DBs with a population of zero is Saskatchewan, followed by Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. From our discussion earlier, we know that Saskatchewan’s landscape is pretty unique: farmlands systematically separated into quadrants, with many roads delineating areas. It is reasonable that much of these DBs have no residents.

### Proportion of population zero DBs' by province

```{r}
# should get proportions
data.frame(table(filter(pmd, pmd$DBPOP == 0)$PRNAME)/table(pmd$PRNAME)) %>% ggplot(aes(factor(Var1), Freq)) + 
  geom_col(fill="steelblue") + 
  labs(x = "",
    title = "Proportion of population zero DBs' by province") +
  geom_text(aes(label= round(Freq, 3)), vjust=-0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Taking the proportions however, we see that over 50% of Yukon and NWT's DBs have a population of 0, and Saskatchewan has over 40%. Ontario has the lowest at around 15%, followed by Quebec at around 18%.
<!--
### DB counts of zero populations by CSDTYPE

```{r}
sort(table(filter(pmd, pmd$DBPOP == 0)$CSDTYPE), decreasing = T)
```

We see that the CSDTYPE with the most populations = zero are rural municipalities followed relatively closely by cities. It seems the majority of the top counts are urban areas (cities, villes, municipalities, etc), which is somewhat unexpected.
-->

## DBs' by Province where all PMS NA

```{r}
# Count the occurrences of each CSDTYPE value
pr_counts <- data.frame(table(all_prox_na$PRNAME))

# Create a bar plot
ggplot(data = pr_counts,
       aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(title = "Number of DBs' by Province where all PMS NA") +
  xlab("Province") +
  ylab("Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

From the above plot, we can observe that DBs where all PMS are NA belong to different provinces. Plotting them on a map could provide a better understanding of their spatial distribution. 

## DBs with all proximity measures equal to 0

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Check if there are any dbs where all proximity measures are 0
all_prox_0 <- pmd[rowSums(pmd[, prox_cols] == 0, na.rm = TRUE) == length(prox_cols), ]
nrow(all_prox_0)
```

There are no dissemination blocks for which all the proximity measures of amenities are 0. So, dissemination blocks with no populations still has the proximity measures of amenities may be those dissemination blocks are close from other populated dissemination blocks, or the dissemination blocks contain parks, office buildings, industrial area, under construction etc.

## DBs with population NA by province

```{r}
pmd %>% filter(is.na(pmd$DBPOP)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(PRNAME))) + 
  geom_bar(fill="steelblue") + 
  labs(x = "",
    title = "DBs with population NA by province") + 
  geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=-0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Some of the population is NA. We see that Quebec has the most DBs with a population NA, followed by Ontario, Alberta, and BC. 

```{r eval=F}
table(filter(pmd, is.na(DBPOP))$CSDTYPE)
```

The CSDTYPE of the DB's whose population information is NA are IRI – Indian reserve and S-É – Indian settlement.

Having NA population values for Indian reserves and S-É may be acceptable due to various reasons:

- Indian Reserves: Indian reserves are designated areas of land reserved for the use and benefit of specific Indigenous communities in Canada. Population data for Indian reserves can be complex and challenging to obtain accurately due to factors such as fluctuating residency, self-governance, and data collection methods. As a result, population counts for Indian reserves may not be readily available or consistently reported, leading to NA values.

- S-É (Schefferville): S-É is a remote community located in Quebec, Canada. It may have unique circumstances or characteristics that affect population data collection or reporting. Factors such as small population size, geographical isolation, or specific demographic considerations can contribute to NA population values.

## Effect of removing population = 0

The null hypothesis of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is that the two samples come from the same distribution. 

```{r}
amen_pval <-c()
n = 0
for (amen in prox_cols_short){
  n = n+1
  amen_pval[n]<- ks.test(filter(df_long_pop_only, df_long_pop_only$name == amen)$value, filter(df_long_pop, df_long_pop$name == amen)$value)[["p.value"]]
}

amen_pvaldf_red <- cbind(prox_cols_short,amen_pval)
amen_pvaldf_red %>% kable() %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

In this above table, we compare the 'sample' where the population = 0 vs the rest. We see that the p-values are very small for every amenity, thus leading us to conclude that we have sufficient evidence to say that these 'samples' don't come from the same distribution.

But in what ways do these subsets differ?

Below we are comparing the histogram for both, where the pink represents the count of population = 0, and the blue the rest. We see that the 'pink' appears to mirror the trends of the 'blue', but on a smaller scale. In the appendix, a 'zoomed in' plot is available. Surprisingly, see there that for some higher proximity 'bins' in transit and health, there are more cases for when population = 0. We also see in the appendix the kernel densities. 


```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=6}
# histograms
ggplot(df_long_red, aes(value, fill = which_df)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 50, alpha = .5, position="identity") + 
    facet_wrap(~name, scales = 'free_y', ncol = 2)
```

```{r}
table(df_long_red$which_df,is.na(df_long_red$value))/cbind(table(df_long_red$which_df), table(df_long_red$which_df))
```

From this above table, we see that 72% of the proximity measure values where population = 0 are NA, compared to 50% of those where population !=0. This follows the intuition that most areas with no populations are areas whose proximity measures are outside of the baseline proximity measure, which a NA value may represent. It may however also mean that most areas with no populations also do not have any information available regarding location of amenities.


# Outliers

Outliers can have a significant impact on the clustering results by pulling the centroids towards themselves, creating biased clusters, and reducing the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm.

## Boxplots of proximity indices

```{r}
# Create the boxplot
ggplot(df, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +

  xlab("") +
  ylab("Value") +
  ggtitle("Boxplots of proximity indices") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The boxplots reveal a significant number of outliers in each proximity index, indicating a substantial deviation from the norm.

## Rosner’s test for Outliers

Rosner's test for multiple outliers is used by VSP to detect up to 10 outliers among the selected data values. This test will detect outliers that are either much smaller or much larger than the rest of the data. Rosner's approach is designed to avoid the problem of masking, where an outlier that is close in value to another outlier can go undetected.

Rosner's test is appropriate only when the data, excluding the suspected outliers, are approximately normally distributed, and when the sample size is greater than or equal to 25.
\href{https://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/vsample/rosners_outlier_test.htm}{Reference}

Just to check we set k=5000, so it will look for 5000 outliers in the data.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Rosner’s test
library(EnvStats)
test <- rosnerTest(pmd$prox_idx_emp, k = 5000, warn = TRUE)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
test$all.stats
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
length(test$all.stats$Outlier == TRUE)
```

The Resnor's test output reveals the presence of 5000 outliers, suggesting that there could be additional outliers in our dataset. This observation provides evidence that a considerable number of proximity values deviate significantly from the rest of the distribution. It is important to note that these outlier values are legitimate and not solely the result of measurement errors, as amenities can be situated far away from DBs while still falling within the threshold values.

<!--
## Chi-squared test  for Outliers

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(outliers)
chisq.out.test(pmd$prox_idx_emp)
```

So the max proximity measure of grocery is an outlier.

```{r echo=TRUE}
chisq.out.test(pmd$prox_idx_emp, opposite = TRUE)
```

So the min proximity measure of grocery is an outlier.
-->

The proximity measures are already normalized but we can still see outliers in these. So, we should use clustering algorithms that can handle outliers.  
For example DBSCAN clustering is robust against outliers when we choose minimum number of points (minPts) - (a threshold) large enough.  
Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) is an algorithm for finding density-based clusters in spatial data which is also robust against outliers.  
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm#cite_note-1}{Reference}
But we can't use general k-means: the squared error approach is sensitive to outliers. But there are variants such as k-medians for handling outliers.  
\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220490566_A_review_of_robust_clustering_methods}{Reference}

Another approach is to apply a transformation to the data that can reduce the impact of outliers. For example, we could apply a log transformation or a power transformation to the data. These transformations can help to reduce the influence of extreme values and make the data more symmetric.


# Log-Transformation of Proximity Measures

Considering the heavily skewed distribution and the presence of numerous outliers in all proximity measures, we are appyling logarithmic transformation to see its effect.

```{r}
# Create a melted data frame for the boxplot
df_log <- reshape2::melt(pmd[, prox_cols])
# log-transformation
df_log$value <- log(df_log$value)

ggplot(df_log, aes(x = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Value") +
  ylab("Density") +
  ggtitle("Density plots of proximity indices") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = 'free_y', nrow = 5) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

After applying the log transformation to the proximity measures, from the above plot we can clearly see distinct clustering patterns in the distributions. The transformation helps to normalize the data and makes the differences between the clusters more noticeable.

## Boxplots of proximity indices on Log Transformed data

```{r}
ggplot(df_log, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Value") +
  ggtitle("Boxplots of proximity indices") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The plot above demonstrates that the application of log transformation has slightly mitigated the impact of outliers. While the proximity measure for employment shows no outliers, there are still a significant number of outliers present in the other proximity measure indices.

# Conclusion

In the original data, there are no easily identifiable clusters in the proximity measures when visually inspected. However, after applying a log transformation, some clustering patterns become apparent. It is important to note that there are still a considerable number of outliers present, which should be taken into consideration when selecting clustering techniques.

The distribution of missing values is not the same across amenities nor provinces. 

Our dataset contains a lot of rows, and there may be question about the 'usefulness' of all of them. If we were to remove all the DBs where the population is 0, we could reduce our dataset by 23%, aiding computationally. There are still proximity measures associated with these DBs with population 0: the distributions of their proximity measures are not the statistically the same as those for the rest of the DBs (those with populations), but the trends appear somewhat similar. 

It doesn't appear that population of a DB is the only factor affecting whether a proximity measure is missing (NA); it was the only one tested as it was the only one included in this dataset. According to StatsCan's definition of a DB however, "only population and dwelling counts are disseminated at the dissemination block level" anyways. If we wanted to analyse other factors, we would have to look into aggregation at a higher level, which is not straighforward.

The absence of proximity measures in certain areas is not a random occurrence, as we have observed that these regions do have a population. However, our primary objective is to cluster the proximity measures. We can approach this task in two ways: firstly, we can remove the rows with missing proximity measures and perform the clustering. Alternatively, we can choose to retain these rows and conduct the clustering analysis to observe any differences in the results
